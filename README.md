# HELLO-WORLD I'M MS GOUWS.A PERSON WHO'S VERY DEDICATED, AND OPEN TO NEW IDEAS AND KNOWLEDGE, ESPECIALLY ONCE I COMMIT MYSELF TO SOMETHING. I THINK OF MYSELF AS A TEAM PLAYER BECAUSE THE GIRL IS QUITE COMMUNICATIVE BUT I ALSO DON'T MIND RIDING SOLO (TAKING SOLO PROJECTS). I COMPLETED MY QUALIFICATION IN 2022 AND HAVEN'T BEEN PERMANANTLY EMPLOYED. I THEN DECIDED TO CHANGE CAREER PATHS AND BE A TECH GIRLY AND SPEND MY TIME ON DOING WHAT I LIKE AND PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT'S WHEN I HEARD OF UMUZI AND I APPLIED RIGHT AWAY. HONESTLY, I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I HOPE IT OPENS CLOSED DOORS. CHEERS TO NEW BEGINNINGS :)
